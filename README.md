## Goals of this repository

1. To gather standards, patterns and workflows which we adopt, in order to
	provide a central source of truth regarding our “current thinking”, which can
	then be applied to individual Lisk projects as and when appropriate.
1. To serve as a base for new projects.

## Usage

When starting a new Lisk project, use this repository as a base. With a few
small customizations, you will have a skeleton project up and running in a few
minutes. The easiest way to bootstrap a new project is using the
`bin/bootstrap.sh` script:

```sh
curl --silent --user my_github_username "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiskHQ/lisk-template/master/bin/bootstrap.sh" | bash -ls my-fresh-lisk-project
```

If you have two-factor authentication enabled on your GitHub account, you will
need to generate an access token rather than authenticating via curl. Having
logged into GitHub using a browser, view [the bootstrap
script][bootstrap-script] in the same browser. Click "Raw" to view the raw file.
Then copy the full URL (including the access token) and run the following:

```sh
curl --silent "the_url_i_just_copied?token=remember_the_token" | bash -ls my-fresh-lisk-project
```

Notes:

* `my_github_username` in the first command should be replaced with your GitHub
	username. You will be prompted for your GitHub password.
* **Watch out**: some terminal applications automatically escape pasted strings,
	which may conflict with the quoting used in the examples above. If you get a
	404 error and you've authenticated successfully with GitHub, check to see if
	the URL has escape characters which should be removed.
* The `-l` option tells bash to act as if it had been invoked as a login shell.
	If you use [nvm][nvm] as your Node.js version manager, then it will be used to
	set the correct version of Node.js when installing NPM dependencies.
* `my-fresh-lisk-project` should be replaced with the name you’ve chosen for
	your new project.

If you would rather complete this process on your own, you should follow these
steps:

1. Clone the repository.
1. Reinitialise git (by removing the `.git` directory, running `git init` and
	committing everything into the initial commit).
1. Find and replace all instances of `lisk-template` with your project name
	(assuming the name of your project is the same as its GitHub namespace).
1. Commit these customization changes.
1. Run `npm install`.

More precise steps can be viewed in the `bin/bootstrap.sh` script.

## package.json

You will need to update the project description. Other fields will be given a
sensible value but may need to be updated depending on the project.

### devDependencies

Installed for your convenience are the following:

1. [Babel][babel] plus various plugins, presets and tools so you can write
	modern JavaScript without worrying about compatibility.
1. [Prettier][prettier] for standard code formatting.
1. [ESLint][eslint] plus various configs and plugins, to enforce additional
	rules beyond Prettier’s remit.
1. [Husky][husky] and [lint-staged][lint-staged] to help with running
	checks/builds before/after various git/NPM commands.
1. [Mocha][mocha], [Chai][chai] and [Sinon][sinon] plus plugins for tests.
1. [nyc][nyc] and [Coveralls][coveralls] for coverage.

These can be removed as appropriate, along with the corresponding NPM scripts.

### Scripts

* `start` will run your source code using `babel-node`, which is not performant
	but does not require transpilation.
* `format` will format your source and test code using Prettier.
* `lint` will lint everything relevant with ESLint.
* `test` will run your tests and instrument your code using nyc. (With the
	initial setup this results in a failing test: the first step in TDD’s
	red-green-refactor process!)
* `test:watch` will watch for changes and rerun your tests.
* `test:watch:min` will do the same but using the `min` reporter (useful if you
	just want to check if your changes break a test).
* `cover` will output a coverage report (differs based on the environment).
* `build` will transpile your source code using Babel.
* `precommit` will format staged files and lint everything before you commit.
* `prepush` will lint and test before you push.
* `prepublishOnly` will run the `prepush` checks and the `build` command.
	**Note: this is run automatically before publishing in NPM v5+ but must be
	performed manually in NPM 3 (the currently supported NPM version).**

## Documentation for contributors

Several files especially relevant for contributors can be found in the `docs`
directory:

* `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` which should probably be left as it is.
* `CONTRIBUTING.md` which will benefit from project-specific customization.
* `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` which may need to be
	adapted to your project.
* Additionally, in the root of the project is the `LICENSE` file, which should
	be left alone unless your project is being released under a different license.
	In this case the `license` field of the `package.json` file should be updated
	as well.

## Project structure

* Source code should go in `src`, test code should go in `test`.
* File and directory names should be `underscore_separated` for best cross-file
	system compatibility. (I.e. not in camel case etc.)
* nyc output goes into `.nyc_output`, and built files are put into a `dist`
	directory which is created when needed.
* Files you do not want to commit can be placed in `.idea` or `tmp` (you will
	need to create these directories yourself).

### Testing structure

The test directory has some configuration and setup files, and is otherwise
divided into a `specs` directory and a `steps` directory. The intention is for
specifications to contain implementation-neutral Mocha suites, and the
(reusable) steps to be implemented in the `steps` directory. See [this
blogpost][gwt-blogpost] for an introduction.

If this approach does not suit your project the structure can be replaced as
necessary. However, the configuration and setup should probably be preserved.
Helpful things in place include:

* Combining Babel, nyc and Mocha.
* Adding Chai’s `expect` as a global, and initialising plugins.
* Adding `Given`, `When` and `Then` from [mocha-bdd][mocha-bdd] as globals.
* Adding `sinon` and a sinon `sandbox` as globals, and resetting the sandbox
	after each test in a global hook (it is recommended to use the sandbox
	wherever possible to avoid manual resets).

## Continuous integration

This project assumes a standard CI setup on Jenkins. There are three
Jenkinsfiles:

* `Jenkinsfile` for branches/PRs which lints, tests, reports coverage to
	Coveralls, and notifies GitHub.
* `Jenkinsfile.private` which checks branches/PRs for known vulnerabilities in
	the installed dependencies using [Snyk][snyk] if `package.json` has changed.
	The results should not be publicly viewable in Jenkins.
* `Jenkinsfile.nightly` which checks the `master` branch for vulnerabilities
	nightly. The results should also not be publicly viewable in Jenkins.

The `.snyk` file configures Snyk.

In order to set up continuous integration for your project you will need to do
the following:

1. Modify the main Jenkinsfile to your requirements.
1. Update your GitHub project settings to allow Jenkins to submit information.
1. Set up the main Jenkins project, the private project, and the private nightly
	project in the `nightly-builds` folder.
1. Add a Coveralls configuration file at `~/.coveralls.yml-lisk-template` on all
	Jenkins nodes that will be used to build lisk-template.

## Miscellaneous information

* `.editorconfig` can be used in combination with plugins for a wide range of
	editors/IDEs to ensure consistency of certain key syntax details.
* `.npmignore` ensures that as little as possible is included when published to
	NPM. This may require adjustment.
* If the project is for a client, or otherwise will not be used as a library in
	other projects, consider replacing `babel-plugin-transform-runtime` and
	`babel-runtime` with `babel-polyfill` (see the
	[details section of the Babel Polyfill documentation](babel-polyfill-details)).
* The official language for all Lisk projects is US English (although we may
	also support translations into other languages on a per-project basis).

## Applying these standards

All of these standards should be applied with the specific project in mind.
There might be good reasons to delay the application of some standard, or to
avoid it completely. In particular, the following are very likely to vary from
project to project:

* The Babel plugins `babel-plugin-transform-runtime` and `babel-runtime` (where
	`babel-polyfill` might make more sense)
* Use of Babel at all
* The `mocha-bdd` dependency and the testing structure
* The `npm start` script
* The `npm run build` script
